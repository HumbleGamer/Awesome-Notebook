## OpenVocabSegmentation_w_CLIPSeg.ipynb
**(1) How to Run Open-Vocabulary Segmentation with CLIPSeg**  
🚀 Includes a pipeline for inference, along with helper functions for image loading and visualization.  

**(2) Analyzing CLIPSeg with Different Inputs**  
- 🌐 **Common sense / world knowledge**: Evaluate CLIPSeg’s ability to leverage broad knowledge for segmentation.  
- 🎨 **Color & spatial relationships**: Test performance on tasks involving color identification and spatial reasoning.  
- 🌍 **Geographic generalization**: Assess robustness across different geographic contexts.  
- 🛰️ **Earth observation domain**: Explore applications in remote sensing and Earth observation imagery.  

**(3) Demonstrate a Potential Downstream Application**  
- Use CLIPSeg as a preprocessing tool for Stable Diffusion v2 **inpainting**.  
- 🖼️ *Say it and erase it!* Generate edited images by combining text-driven segmentation with diffusion-based synthesis.
